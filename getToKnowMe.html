					<h2>Systems Engineering</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="grid-4">
					<ul>
						<li>Architected and built multiple structural dynamics test systems for structural mode analysis on test articles from engine components to flight test airplanes; wrote user documents; trained teams on use of specialized test equipment; performed requirements management, verification & validation; executed lab and flight test procedures; automated data system startup sequence to reduce startup time from 15 minutes to 25 seconds.</li>
						<li>Analyzed 415+ test lab design requirements and identified non-compliances. Collaborated with customers to eliminate low value requirements. Facilitated resolution of compliance issues and elimination of low value features avoiding $300K in rework and waste.</li>
						<li>Built data system software infrastructure to support flight testing. Contributed data and analysis to FAA certification of 3 airplane models. Certification data enabled first airplane deliveries for initial generation of revenue worth ~$250M/airplane.</li>
            <li>Initiated and led a trade study to down select from (3) external power system design alternatives for an electric power generation lab. Identified and oversaw implementation of a solution that maintained all design requirements while reducing cost by $24K.</li>

					<h2>Project Management</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="grid-4">
					<ul>
						<li>Served as project manager for 5 capital asset procurement projects and design, build, and test projects of 2 airplane level integration labs. Project budgets ranged from $120K to $10M. Responsibilities included: Developing statement of work documents to request bids and get suppliers on contract, collaboration with supplier, customer, and internal technical teams; cost estimating; scheduling; change management; demonstrating performance to plan; earned value reporting; process improvements and creation where none existed.</li>
						<li>Led $10M, 14 month capital asset procurement project. Managed internal team of 8 and supplier, through design, build, installation, and check out to deliver the compliant asset $600K under budget.</li>
						<li> Automated daily status reporting for lab design project releasing 140+ technical drawings. Reduced status update time from 20 hours/week to 1 hour/week.</li>
						<li>Created a resource-loaded lab design schedule for 10 engineers over 9 months. Identified the need for additional design engineers to complete lab design on time. Obtained approval to hire 5 additional engineers in a reduction environment. Led design team to complete lab design on time, within budget.</li>

					<h2>Software Development</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="grid-4">
					<ul>
						<li>Collaborated with users to create dynamics data acquisition software requirements; introduced modern user interface features and documentation techniques to improve user experience, reliability, and code reuse; automated analysis tasks to reduce data reduction time; wrote user manuals and trained users on software operations.</li>
						<li>Streamlined inter process communication for data acquisition software suite by using 0MQ to migrate from a “request-reply” messaging pattern to a “publish-subscribe” pattern. Decreased average update rate from once every 200ms to once every 10s.</li>
						<li>Created a data object to import data from legacy, binary data files into Matlab. Enabled customers to create custom data reports and analyze data using the built-in tools of the Matlab environment.</li>
